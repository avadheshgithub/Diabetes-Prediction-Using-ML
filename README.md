# Diabetes Prediction ML Models



## **Introduction**

This repository contains machine learning models to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on medical diagnostic measurements. We have utilized two different algorithms to perform this task: Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 100%, while the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 97.5%.



## **Algorithms Used**

1. Random Forest Algorithm
   
          Accuracy: 100%

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   
          Accuracy: 97.5%



 ## **Steps to Perform the Analysis**


    1.  Load the Dataset
    
    2.  Pre-process the Dataset
    
    3.  Import Libraries
    
    4.  Train the Model
    
    5.  Train the Random Forest model.
    
    6.  Check Accuracy
    
    7.  Predict on New Data
    
    8.  Visualization
